# Car Prices Analysis and Prediction

This project performs a comprehensive analysis and predictive modeling on a car price dataset. It explores various car features and their influence on vehicle pricing through visual and statistical techniques. Additionally, the project builds models to predict car prices based on key attributes.

## Overview

The notebook includes:
- Feature definitions and understanding of car-related variables
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) including visualizations and statistical summaries
- Correlation analysis to assess influential variables
- Building regression models to predict car prices

## Features

- Detailed explanation of dataset features
- Analysis of categorical and numerical variables
- Visual insights into pricing trends by manufacturer, body type, engine characteristics, etc.
- Predictive modeling using regression techniques

## How to Run

This notebook is designed for **Google Colab**:

1. Open the `.ipynb` file in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Run each cell sequentially
3. Required libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `sklearn` will be imported within the notebook

## Output

- Visual charts and graphs illustrating car price trends
- Summary statistics and correlations
- Predictive insights from regression models
